# ESP32-C6-MINI-1 Partition Table Explanation (4 MB flash)
# ===================================================================
# 
# Partition Layout Overview:
# --------------------------
# The flash is organized into several partitions. Each partition has:
# - Name: logical name used by the system or your application
# - Type: 'app' or 'data'
# - SubType: specifies role (e.g., ota_0, ota_1, spiffs, nvs)
# - Offset: starting flash address (must be 0x10000-aligned for app partitions)
# - Size: size of the partition in bytes (hex)
# - Flags: optional, can usually be left blank
#
# Partition Definitions:
# ----------------------
# 1. nvs
#    Type: data
#    SubType: nvs
#    Offset: 0x9000
#    Size: 0x7000 (28 KB)
#    Purpose: Non-volatile key-value storage used for:
#       - Wi-Fi credentials
#       - Preferences API data
#       - PHY calibration and system parameters
#
# 2. otadata
#    Type: data
#    SubType: ota
#    Offset: 0x10000
#    Size: 0x2000 (8 KB)
#    Purpose: OTA metadata used by the bootloader to track which app partition
#             should be booted. Must be present if OTA updates are used.
#
# 3. app0
#    Type: app
#    SubType: ota_0
#    Offset: 0x20000
#    Size: 0x180000 (1.5 MB)
#    Purpose: Primary firmware slot for OTA updates. This is where the current
#             running firmware is stored.
#
# 4. app1
#    Type: app
#    SubType: ota_1
#    Offset: 0x1A0000
#    Size: 0x180000 (1.5 MB)
#    Purpose: Secondary firmware slot for OTA updates. When performing OTA,
#             new firmware is written here, then the bootloader switches to it.
#
# 5. spiffs
#    Type: data
#    SubType: spiffs
#    Offset: 0x340000
#    Size: 0x20000 (128 KB)
#    Purpose: SPI Flash File System for storing:
#       - Web UI assets (HTML/CSS/JS)
#       - Configuration files
#       - Other persistent application data
#
# Alignment Notes:
# ----------------
# - App partitions (app0 and app1) must start at multiples of 0x10000 (64 KB) for proper flash alignment.
# - SPIFFS and data partitions can be less strictly aligned, but staying on 0x10000 boundaries is recommended.
# - NVS must end before the first 0x10000 boundary so that app0 can start properly.
#
# Total Flash Usage:
# ------------------
# 4 MB total flash:
# - nvs + otadata: 36 KB
# - app0 + app1: 3 MB
# - spiffs: 128 KB
# - Remaining space: bootloader, alignment padding
